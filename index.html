       <h3> SUMMARY </h3>
       <P> I am a coder, designer and a photographer from New Delhi, India. I have always been passionate about desiging and arts. As a kid I was always doing arts and carfts. I wanted to build things. The arts and crafts were a way for me to talk and convey effectively. As a result, I picked a profession to allow and help people in giving their dreams to come to life by designing and building a really cool website. These websites will convey what you want to say, how you want to say and to whom you to say it to!</P>
